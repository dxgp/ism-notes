### Introduction
Audits fall under the category of **security diagnostics**. Security diagnostics include:
1. Information security audits
2. Vulnerability Assessments
3. Penetration testing

**Information security audit**: It is a _systematic, measurable, technical_ assessment of how the organization's security policy is employed. It is part of the on-going process of defining and maintaining effective security policies. This work is done through _personal interviews, reviewing policies, vulnerability scans, examination of OS settings, analyses of network shares and historical data and logs_.

The scope of the audit depends on:

1. Site business plan
2. Type of data assets to be protected
3. Value of importance of the data and relative priority.
4. Previous security incidents
5. Time available
6. Auditors experience and expertise

The purpose of an audit is:

1. Build awareness of current practices and risks.
2. Reducing risk, by evaluating, planning and supplementing security efforts.
3. Strengthening controls including both automated and human.
4. Compliance with customer and regulatory requirements and expectations.
5. Building awareness and interaction between technology and business teams.
6. Improving overall IT governance in the organization.

### Types of Security Audits
There are two types of audits:
1. **External audits**: Commonly conducted by independent, certified in an objective manner. They are scoped in advance, finally limited to identifying and reporting any implementation and control gaps based on stated policies and standards such as COBIT. The ultimate objective is to lead the clent to a new source of accepted principles and best practices.
2. **Internal audits**: Condicted by experts within the organization. It involves a feedback process where the auditor may not only audit the system but also provide limited advice. They differ from external audits in the advice part. Advice given in external audits is detailed.
