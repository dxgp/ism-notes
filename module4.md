### Introduction
Audits fall under the category of **security diagnostics**. Security diagnostics include:
1. Information security audits
2. Vulnerability Assessments
3. Penetration testing

**Information security audit**: It is a _systematic, measurable, technical_ assessment of how the organization's security policy is employed. It is part of the on-going process of defining and maintaining effective security policies. This work is done through _personal interviews, reviewing policies, vulnerability scans, examination of OS settings, analyses of network shares and historical data and logs_.

### Types of Security Audits
There are two types of audits:
1. **External audits**: Commonly conducted by independent, certified in an objective manner. They are scoped in advance, finally limited to identifying and reporting any implementation and control gaps based on stated policies and standards such as COBIT. The ultimate objective is to lead the clent to a new source of accepted principles and best practices.
2. **Internal audits**: Condicted by experts within the organization. It involves a feedback process where the auditor may not only audit the system but also provide limited advice. They differ from external audits in the advice part. Advice given in external audits is detailed.

### Phases of Information Security Audit
1. **Pre-audit agreement stage**
2. **Initiation and planning stage**
3. **Data collection and fieldwork**
4. **Analysis**
5. **Reporting**
