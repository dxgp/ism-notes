## Module 4
### Introduction
Audits fall under the category of **security diagnostics**. Security diagnostics include:
1. Information security audits
2. Vulnerability Assessments
3. Penetration testing

**Information security audit**: It is a _systematic, measurable, technical_ assessment of how the organization's security policy is employed. It is part of the on-going process of defining and maintaining effective security policies. This work is done through _personal interviews, reviewing policies, vulnerability scans, examination of OS settings, analyses of network shares and historical data and logs_.

### Types of Security Audits
There are two types of audits:
1. **External audits**: Commonly conducted by independent, certified in an objective manner. They are scoped in advance, finally limited to identifying and reporting any implementation and control gaps based on stated policies and standards such as COBIT. The ultimate objective is to lead the clent to a new source of accepted principles and best practices.
2. **Internal audits**: Condicted by experts within the organization. It involves a feedback process where the auditor may not only audit the system but also provide limited advice. They differ from external audits in the advice part. Advice given in external audits is detailed.

### Phases of Information Security Audit
1. **Pre-audit agreement stage**: The auditor and auditee agree on the scope, objective, level of support, locations, duration, finances and confidentiality parameters. A formal agreement is created that states the objectives, scope and protocol.
2. **Initiation and planning stage**: Conducting a preliminary review of the client's environment, mission, operations, policies and practices. A risk assessment of the client environment, data and technology resources is performed after completing research on regulation, industry standards, practices and issues. Current policies are then reviewed and an _entrance meeting_ is held to review the engagement memo, request items from the client, schedule client resources and answer client questions. This is the phase where the timeline of the audit is established.
3. **Data collection and fieldwork**: Enough evidence is acumulated in this stage to reach a conclusion related to the audit objectives and to support audit findings and recommendations. The auditor conducts interviews, observes procedures and practices and performs automated and manual tests. (This stage may be onsite or remote)
4. **Analysis**: Once all the evidence is documented, analyses are performed to generate the audit findings. Any open issues are addressed at this stage. At the end of this stage, the auditor holds an _exit meeting_ with the client to discuss findings and recommendations, address client questions, discuss corrective actions and resolve outstanding issues. A first draft of the findings may be presented at this stage.
5. **Reporting**: Once analysis is done, a draft of the report is generated. After incorporating any recommendations made by the client, the final report is comiled.
6. **Follow through**: The auditor evaluates the effectiveness of the corrective action taken by the client and presents his opinion. Several follow ups may be required in complex cases. The time between the reporting anf follow up phase is dictated by the level of risk and the severity of the vulnerabilities.

### Auditing Methodologies
We need auditing methodologies because audits need to be planned to cover the total material risks of an organization. It's also important because it ensures that all subjects approach the audit in the same manner. The methodologies are:
1. Testing: Exercising assessment objects to compare actual and expected behavior.
2. Examination and review: This include reviewing policies, processes, logs, other documents, practices, briefings, situation handling, etc. In other words, checking, inspecting, reviewing, observing, studying, or analyzing assessment objects
3. Interviews and discussion: Involves group discussions, individual interviews, etc.

The audit process is:
1. Create a list of risks to an organization.
2. Develop a plan to alleviate those risks.
3. Validate that the risks have been mitigated.
4. Develop an ongoing process to minimize risk.
5. Establish a cycle of reviews.

The audit tasks are as follows:
1. Pre-audit tasks
2. Information gathering
3. External Security Audit
4. Internal Network Security Auditing
5. Firewall Security Auditing
6. IDS Security Auditing
7. Social Engineering Audit



## Disaster Recovery Plan

**Disaster recovery plans (DRPs)**: Seek to quickly redirect available resources into restoring data and information systems following a disaster. DRPs are considered as a critical subset of an entity's larger business continuity plan (BCP) which seeks to prepare for, prevent and recover from potential threats affecting an organization.

**Business impact analysis (BIA)**: Identifies the imact of a sudden loss of business functions, usually quantified as cost. It also helps evaluate whether outsourcing some activities may be benificial.

BCDR planning is important because:
1. Results of the BIA identify opportunities for process improvement and ways the organization may use technology better.
2. Information in the plan serves as a valuable source of documentation.
3. The plan provides a single source of key contact information.
4. It serves as a reference document for use in product planning and design, service design and delivery and other activities.
5. An organization's improvement is driven by the BCDR process.

### How to Build a BCDR Plan
The general guidelines are as follows:
1. Break down the process into two components: Business Continuity (BC) and Disaster Recovery (DR). 
2. The BCP should contain contact information, change management procedures, guidelines on how and when to use the plan, step by step procedures and a schedule for reviewing, testing and updating.
3. The DRP should contain a summary of key action steps, contact information, defined responsibilities of the DR team, guidelines on how and when to use the DRP, the DR policy statement, plan goals, incident response and recovery steps, authentication tools, geographical risks and plan history.
4. The DRO should also take staffing into account ensuring that the staff are able to execute the steps of the plan and are always available.
5. The plan should also take into account third parties and the services they provide. These entities must be kept in the loop and must understand how the plan works.
6. After the organization writes the step by step procedures, the documents should consistently tested, reviewed and updated.

The process follows the following steps:
1. Risk Identification
2. Infrastructure review
3. Business impact analysis
4. Plan design
5. Plan implementation
6. Testing

### How to Build a DRP
The steps that must be followed are:
1. **Disaster recovery team**: The DR team will be responsible for developing, implementing and maintaining the DRP. The DRP must identify the team members along with their assigned responsibilities. All employees must be familiar with the DRP.
2. **Risk identification**: The DR team should identify and assess the risks to the organization. This step should include items related to natural disasters, man-made emergencies and technology related incidents. This will help the team in identifying the recovery strategies and resources required to recover from the disaster in an acceptable timeframe.
3. **Determining critical resources**: The organization must evaluate its business processes to determine which processes are absolutely necessary. The plan should focus on short term survivability rather than offer a solution to restoring the business to its full operational capacity.
4. **Backup procedures**: These procedures should identify what to back up, by whom, how to perform the backup, location of backup and how frequently backups should occur. All critical documents must be backup up (like latest financial statements, tax returns, a current list of employees, inventory records, customer and vendor listings). Critical supplies requred for daily operation such as checks and purchase orders and a copy of the DRP should be stored at an off-sitee location.
5. **Maintenance**: DR planning is a continual process as risks of disasters and emergencies are always changing. It's recommended that the organization routinely test the DRP to evaluate the procedures documented in the plan for effectiveness. The DRP must be constantly maintained to be effective.

A DRP is defined by two factors:
1. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Acceptable downtime for critical functions and components i.e. the maximum time it should take to restore services. Different components of the business have different RTOs.
2. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: The point to which the services must be restored following a disruption. In relation to the backup data, it specifies the oldest age the backup can have.

Some standards that are relevant to BCDR planning:
1. ISO 22301:2019: Security and reselience -- Business continuity management systems -- Requirements
2. ISO 22313:2012: Soceital security -- Business continuity management systems -- Guidance
3. ISO 22320:2018: Security and resilience -- Emergency management -- Guidelines for incident management
